Simple installation example: Puma http://mezeylab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/Software.aspx
Complex installation examples: Sphinx http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seunghak/SPHINX/ or Needles https://github.com/arnedc/Needles

Attributes of a simple installation:
- Application is in the form of a binary executable with all dependencies already included
- Separate dependencies are few and easily accessible
- Clear requirements for inputs and formats - makes it easier to write a wrapper
- Easily usable set of example files for a test script

Puma was relatively simple to install because it is distributed as a single binary file with all dependencies included, has a detailed readme with descriptions of the input requirements
