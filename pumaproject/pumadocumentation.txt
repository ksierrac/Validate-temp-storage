Example json job file to run Puma:
https://github.com/CyVerse-Validate/Stampede-Files/blob/master/Puma/test-job.json

Inputs:
tped (required)          [genotype data in plink TPED format]
tfam  (required)         [phenotype (and sex) data in plink TFAM format]
sex            			 [if tfam is used, this includes sex as a covariate]
covariates     			 [file storing matrix with each column being a covariate]
regression (required)    [specify regression model as either LINEAR or LOGISTIC]
sma            			 [if set, performs only standard single marker analysis]
penalty (required)       [space delimited list of methods to run, select from:
							LASSO ALASSO LOG NEG MCP VBAY]
name (required)      	 [name to be appended to results files]

Advanced inputs:
screen_p_value [marginal p-values below which markers are passed to method]
		         (default = 0.01)
pML_restarts   [number of posterior modes explored]
		         (default = 100)
results        [specify folder where results are saved. Defaults to local folder]
nthreads       [number of threads used to run in parallel]
		         (default = machine default)
restrictedPathSearch [1 dimensional path search for non-convex penalties]

Use R to process returned results:
Place a copy of extract_puma_results.R in your working directory (https://github.com/CyVerse-Validate/Stampede-Files/blob/master/Puma/extract_puma_results.R)
Modify the file with your results file name (example: "results_testjob_LASSO.R") in line 9: result = dget("FILENAME.R")
Save extract_puma_results.R
Start R and run these lines:

sink('OUTPUTFILENAME.txt')
print(source('extract_puma_results.R'))
sink()

This will place the results summary in your working directory.
